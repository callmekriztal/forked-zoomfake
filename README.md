### Project Description
A fake zoom app sends glitches the screen according to the sound input.It sends urgent poiintless  messages to leave the meeting.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Meetings are too stable, too productive, and disturbingly sane.
In a world where everyone just wants to nod politely and pretend to listen, there’s no chaos. No mystery. No panic attacks triggered by phantom error messages. We decided that’s unacceptable.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
🎥 It starts like any normal meeting — your webcam turns on, your mic is ready...
🔊 But say something even slightly loud, and BAM — the screen glitches like it just saw a ghost.
💬 Every 5 seconds, it spits out totally serious-looking yet completely made-up system errors:
