# [Project Name] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [ctrl+alt+Salad]


### Team Members
- Member 2: [Christy Dominic Cyril] - [RIT KOTTAYAM]
- Member 3: [Arun Mathews]- [RIT KOTTAYAM]

### Project Description
[A fake zoom app sends glitches the screen according to the sound input.It sends urgent poiintless  messages to leave the meeting.]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[Meetings are too stable, too productive, and disturbingly sane.
In a world where everyone just wants to nod politely and pretend to listen, there‚Äôs no chaos. No mystery. No panic attacks triggered by phantom error messages. We decided that‚Äôs unacceptable.]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[üé• It starts like any normal meeting ‚Äî your webcam turns on, your mic is ready...
üîä But say something even slightly loud, and BAM ‚Äî the screen glitches like it just saw a ghost.
üí¨ Every 5 seconds, it spits out totally serious-looking yet completely made-up system errors:]
